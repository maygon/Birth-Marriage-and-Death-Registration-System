    <h4>BIRTH</h4>
    <h4>The parents of the child are in charge of registering births. Therefore, each 
      parent must remember the following when registering their child:</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>Before your child is born, make sure you've chosen a name for him or her. The registration 
          process will be simplified as a result.</li>
      
      <li>As soon as a baby is born, record all births. The first six weeks must pass 
          before the birth is required by law to be registered.</li>
      
      <li>A close relative or someone with knowledge of the birth must 
          sign the registration form as an informant if the </li>
      
      <li>A Late Registration application must be filled out in order to obtain a birth certificate 
          for the child if the registration of the birth occurs more than a year after the event.
         </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>BEDSIDE REGISTRATION</h4>
      <p>At the mother's bedside while she is still in the hospital, the Registrar General's Department now 
       registers births and stillbirths. This has significantly improved the way that these important
       occurrences are recorded. All hospitals on the island have trained registration officers stationed 
       there to handle these registrations. These officials work for the Agency. Important details are 
       recorded for civil registration purposes, such as the child's date of birth, sex, mother's name, 
       and the presence of a doctor or midwife at the time of birth. A flowchart of the Bedside Registration 
       procedure can be seen by clicking here.</p>


    <h4>WHOSE DUTY IS IT TO REGISTER A BIRTH?</h4>
      <p>Births that take place outside of a hospital or birthing facility: If a child is born outside of 
         a hospital, the parent(s) are responsible for registering the birth. If the parents are unable to do
         so, the birth should be registered by a family member, </p>

    <h4>WHERE ARE BIRTHS REGISTERED?</h4>
      <p>In hospitals and birthing facilities, births are registered. Any births, deaths, and stillbirths that 
        take place in a registration district must be registered by a Local District Registrar, who is chosen 
        by the Registrar General. Jamaica's fourteen parishes are divided into districts, and the LDRs are 
        typically found in the same district as or close to the districts they are in charge of.
      </p><p>In the district where the birth took place, it must be done. For instance, a birth that takes place
         in Spanish Town, St. Catherine, needs to be registered at the LDR there. A Birth Entry Number is assigned
          to each birth when it is registered. Each child's birth registration record is identified by this special
           number. The distinct entry number identifies a district's parish, its district, and the order of births 
           that were recorded during the child's birth year.<p>For instance, a birth in Spanish Town, St. Catherine, 
            would be assigned an entry number like EA 103, where "E" stands for the parish of birth, in this case, St. 
            Catherine, and "A" stands for the district, in this case, Spanish Town.</p>


    <h4>HOW SOON AFTER BIRTH SHOULD THE EVENT BE REGISTERED?</h4>
    <h4>All births must be registered:</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>Ideally within six weeks and less than one year</li>
      
      <li>Within 14 days – Chief Resident Officer must send the notification of birth to LDR.</li>

    </ul>

    <h4>Parents should visit the Registration Officer for the district where the child was born and complete
       a Certificate of Naming if the infant is not named in the hospital.</h4>
    <h4></h4>

    <ul>
      <li>Give full and correct information</li>
      
      <li>Check for the correct spelling of name</li>

      <li>Check date of birth</li>

      <li>Sign registration form only if all the information is correct</li>

      <li>Collect Certificate of Registry (pink paper/slip)</li>

      <li>Keep a record of the Birth Entry Number for reference</li>

    </ul>

    <h4>HOSPITAL BIRTHS</h4>
    <h4>The majority of births in Jamaica take place in hospitals or other birthing facilities.
        The parent(s)' registration process is as follows:</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>The mother, father, and child's complete information must be given. If the parents were not married at the 
          time of the child's birth, the father must either be present to sign the birth record in person or both parents must
           sign and submit a declaration of paternity within six weeks of the child's birth in order for the father's name to be included.</li>
        
        <li>If the child's name has not been decided upon at the time of hospital registration, the parent(s) will be provided a Certificate 
          of Naming and instructions on how to complete and submit the form to the registration officer within a year. The child's name can only 
          be added to the birth certificate after this period of one year has passed by paying for the Late Entry of Name application at the Registrar General's Department.</li>

        <h4>A birth certificate will be provided to eligible infants who were: within three months of the birth registration form being completed by the Registration Officer and bearing 
          all necessary signatures.</h4>

        <li>Hospital is named; and</li>

        <li>They paid the registration fee.</li>

      </ul>

      <h4>HOME/OTHER BIRTHS</h4>
      <h4>Children born outside of a hospital or birthing facility must have their births documented as follows:</h4>
  
        <ul>
          <li>To record the birth, an informant must go to the closest Local District Registrar (LDR). This individual may be the child's parent, 
            a witness to the birth, the resident of the home
             where the birth took place, or any other adult who is aware of the child's birth;</li>
          
          <li>Within six months, or at least one year following birth, the informant must come into the LDR's office.
            A late registration application will be necessary after one year;</li>
  
          <li>Similar to hospital birth registration, an "A and B registration" must be completed at the LDR if the parents are not married 
            in order to add the father's information at the time of registration;</li>
  
          <li>The LDR fills up the birth registration form and adds the necessary signatures;</li>
  
          <li>Within six weeks of the registration, the original registration is sent to the Registrar General's Department's headquarters;</li>
  
         
  
        </ul>


        <h4>DEATH</h4>
        <p>It is required to categorize deaths as natural, abrupt, or violent for registration purposes. Natural deaths are ones in which the decedent
          was receiving regular medical care from a physician (within six weeks of death) and in which the physician has no reasonable doubt as to the cause of death.</p>
        <p>When a person dies suddenly, it usually means that they weren't being treated by a doctor within six weeks of their passing and/or that there is some reason to
           suspect foul play. As the term implies, violent deaths are those that took place in violent situations.</p>

           <h4>A medical professional, medical officer, or pathologist must complete and certify one of the following for 
            each death:</h4>
          <ul>    
            <li>Medical Certificate of the Cause of Death</li>

            <li>Post Mortem Examination Report</li>

            <li>Certificate of Coroner</li>

            <li>Coroner’s Certificate of Finding of Jury</li>
    
          </ul>

<h4>MARRIAGE</h4>
<p>The marriage is registered by the Civil Registrar or Marriage Officer who officiated</p>
<p>1. How can I become a Marriage Officer/Civil Registrar?</p>
<p>Ans. “All applications by ministers of religion for appointment as Marriage Officers must be in writing to
the Registrar-General.” Also a checklist stating additional requirements can be located on the RGD website
or you can visit any of the RGD offices.</p>

<p>2. What is the difference between a Marriage Officer and a Civil Registrar?</p>
<p>Ans. A Marriage Officer is a minister of Religion appointed to conduct marriages while “a Civil Registrar
shall be ex officio a marriage officer”. You do not have to be a Minister of Religion to become a Civil
Registrar however only Ministers of Religion can apply to become a Marriage Officer.</p>

<p>3. Should the RGD be notified when a Marriage Officer or Civil Registrar leaves the island?</p>
<p>Ans. Yes, the Marriage Officer is require to submit in writing of him or her leaving the island and state
date of return. Also all books must be submitted to the office for safe keeping. Failure to notify the RGD
when travelling overseas constitutes a breach under the Marriage Act which can result in de-gazetting.</p>

  <div class="panel">
   
    <p>The provision of timely data and analyses that are categorized in accordance with international standards to promote democratic 
      planning by the government is one of the department's main goals. For the development and evaluation of national initiatives in sectors 
      like education and health, vital statistics offer essential information. Accordingly, it is essential that the Agency not only keeps track 
      of all life-changing occurrences (births, deaths, and marriages) that take place in Jamaica, but also makes sure that high integrity standards 
      are upheld when gathering, compiling, and presenting such data. The cooperation of numerous groups within
      and connected to the Agency is necessary in order to produce timely and useful vital statistics. Local 
      District Registrars (LDRs), who record life-changing events like births and deaths, Marriage Officers, 
      who officiate weddings and solemnize unions, Medical Officers, who provide information from hospitals, 
      and the Police and Courts Office Staff for Corners' cases are some of these groups.The Annual Statistical 
      Report, which seeks to provide statistics on significant events like births, deaths, marriages, and summaries 
      of causes of deaths, is produced and prepared for publication by the Registrar General's Department with pleasure.</p>
